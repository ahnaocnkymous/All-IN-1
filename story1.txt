Yesterday, I went to the <place> to buy some <plural_noun>.
When I got there, I saw a <adjective> <animal> wearing a <color> <clothing_item>.
It was <verb_ing> right in the middle of the <place>!
I asked the <animal> if it wanted to join me for <food>, and it <past_tense_verb> happily.
We ended up spending the whole day <verb_ing> together, and it was the most <adjective> day ever.
